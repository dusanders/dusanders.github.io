    <p>
        Hello, my name is Dustin Anderson and I a love to build things. I am attending my final year at the University of Wisconsin-Superior earning a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
        I am passionate about all things code, always tinkering with what I can do and taking every chance I can to learn something new. If you put me on the spot about what I am 
        <span style="font-style:italic; ">most</span> passionate about; I would say anything embedded as I like the idea of building software that interacts with the physical world. All of my 
        projects have been created with Windows or Linux operating systems and using a host of different development tools including; Visual Studio 2013, Eclipse, Android Studio, Code 
        Composer Studio, and IAR Embedded Workbench.

    <h3 style="text-align:center;">About the Site</h3>
    <p>
       This site was built by me as a project to teach myself HTML and CSS, with a small amount of JQuery. This is a collection of things that I have done during my time at the University of Wisconsin-Superior,
        along with some projects that I worked on during my free time. Please feel free to have a look around.
